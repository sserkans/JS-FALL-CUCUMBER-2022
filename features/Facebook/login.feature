# How to do handle/write DDT in Cucumber (BDD)
# Ans: using Scenario Outline with Examples


# Scenario: Verify user can add payment method - Saving
#     Given user is on Payment page
#     When user clicks add Payment method button
#     And user selects Saving account
#     And user enters account number as 123456789
